# Instant Feedback

Very basic application to capture instant stall feedback at a company offsite.

Made up of a single html file incorporating css styles and basic javascript to add interactivity.
No backends, databases or anything like that - this is a simple app using browser storage.

## Usage

* Open index.html
* Click appropriate face according to current amusement/bemusement.
* Scores are held in local browser storage
* Current scores can be viewed/reset via hidden button bottom right of screen
